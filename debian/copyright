  We reserve no legal rights to the ANTLR--it is fully in the public
  domain. An individual or company may do whatever they wish with source
  code distributed with ANTLR or the code generated by ANTLR, including
  the incorporation of ANTLR, or its output, into commercial software.
  .
  We encourage users to develop software with ANTLR. However, we do ask
  that credit is given to us for developing ANTLR. By "credit", we mean
  that if you use ANTLR or incorporate any source code into one of your
  programs (commercial product, research project, or otherwise) that you
  acknowledge this fact somewhere in the documentation, research report,
  etc... If you like ANTLR and have developed a nice tool with the output,
  please mention that you developed it using ANTLR. In addition, we ask
  that the headers remain intact in our source code. As long as these
  guidelines are kept, we expect to continue enhancing this system and
  expect to make other tools available as they are completed.
